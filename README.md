## Usage

Once running, the application provides a straightforward interface:

- **Timer Mode:**  
  - Input your desired countdown duration.
  - Press the "Start Timer" button to begin the countdown.
  - Use "Pause" and "Reset" to manage timing as needed.

- **Stopwatch Mode:**  
  - Simply press "Start" to begin tracking elapsed time.
  - Use "Lap" to record intervals or "Stop" to finish the session.
  - Reset the time when necessary.

Interactive controls have been optimized for rapid use in both casual and professional environments.

## How It Works

The application's functionality is divided into several key modules:

1. **User Interface (UI):**  
   The design emphasizes clarity and ease of navigation. A set of intuitive buttons and displays lets users control the timer/stopwatch, with animations to provide instant feedback on interactions.

2. **Timer Logic:**  
   - Uses high-precision JavaScript timing functions to ensure accurate countdown behavior.
   - Implements mechanisms to handle pause, resume, and reset functions seamlessly.

3. **Stopwatch Logic:**  
   - Continuously tracks elapsed time with millisecond precision.
   - Incorporates lap functionality to mark periods during a timing session.

4. **Deployment Workflow:**  
   - The project is continuously integrated with GitHub, ensuring that every update is automatically deployed through Vercel for real-time access.
   - This workflow guarantees that the live version is always up to date with the latest codebase.

## Future Improvements

There are several ideas in the pipeline to enhance the functionality:

- **Enhanced Styling:** Additional themes and customization options for the interface.
- **Advanced Features:**  
  - Multiple timer instances concurrently.
  - Integration with calendar apps for reminders.
- **Performance Optimization:** Further tuning to handle extremely long timing sessions and improve battery efficiency on mobile devices.
- **Accessibility Enhancements:** Improved support for screen readers and keyboard navigation.
